Crawls the web, made in Python.

In the command line: "print crawl_web('input your url here')

It will output a list titled 'index' which consists of keywords 
and urls associated with the keywords.

Current problem: Goes on forever, I plan to limit the amount of links the
crawler visits to a certain amount, because it finds the links on a page and
visits all of them. Apparently Google discovered that for every link you find,
two more links will be available when following that link!
